# cpp-interface-cplex [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/dqrobotics/cpp-interface-cplex.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/dqrobotics/cpp-interface-cplex)
Interface between DQ Robotics and IBM's CPLEX

# Installation in Ubuntu 16.04 or Ubuntu 18.04

The dqrobotics-cpp-interface-cplex is a special case since we cannot add it to the PPA due to the dependencies it has with the CPLEX headers.

We will provide debian packages in the future.
